    "As a newly graduated programmer and you are new to Generative AI, your team leader gives you an opportunity to familiarise yourself with a simple generative model to generate simple images before moving to more advanced and realistic models. Your team leader asks you to start by using CLIP, which is a model built by OpenAI for generating images from text (https://openai.com/research/clip), or an equivalent model of your choice, to write a Python program to generate simple images from text and conduct some research and experiments to enhance your understanding in Generative AI.
